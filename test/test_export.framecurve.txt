# This is a framecurve file representing a timewarp,
# The first column is the frame in the scene, the second column
# is the frame that needs to be used from the original video or
# the original animation. A tab is between the columns and linebreaks are CRLF.
# Destination frames are always listed sequentially.
# We assume that the FIRST frame of source animation/video is frame 1 (so frames are one-based)
